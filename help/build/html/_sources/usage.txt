Usage
============
 
The plugin adds a submenu in the plugins menu. The entry *Initialize Layer*
(re)initializes the active layer in the project with the DataDrivenInputMask.

Accessing the mask
---------------------

* The initialization adds an action to the layer. With this action the mask can be accessed by simply clicking on a feature.
* If a feature is selected the submenu's entry *Show Input Form* opens the mask, too.
